            <p class="notes">Your gym website is where members will view your fitness class schedule,make a booking, and
                find out what services you offer. A great fitness website example is F45 Training. It has a clean and
                minimalist design with compelling messaging. When you land on the site, you can click New to F45,
                Workouts, and Why F45 Works. At first glance, the site sorts users into existing members and new
                visitors
                and gauges fitness levels and abilities. You can then easily find an F45 studio near you and make a
                booking.
                The training class descriptions tell visitors exactly what to expect, and the site navigation is easy to
                use. Well take a look at F45s website more closely later in this article.
